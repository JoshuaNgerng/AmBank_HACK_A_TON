Save for the periods between 2021 and 2022 as well as 2023 and 2024, the wholesale \nvalue of petroleum products in Malaysia has demonstrated a growth trend similar to the country\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct (\u201cGDP\u201d) as illustrated under Demand Conditions Key Growth Drivers of the Independent Market Research \nReport. In 2024, the demand for petroleum products grew at a lower rate than Malaysia's GDP, reflecting the \nmoderation in wholesale and retail trade activities during the year, rising adoption of renewable energy and particularly \nsolar as a fuel source for power generation as well as volatility in crude oil prices. \n \nThe demand for petroleum products is closely correlated with economic growth and the expansion of end-user \nmarkets, as petroleum products are a key source of fuel for transportation, manufacturing, and electricity generation, \namong other applications. The independent market researcher, Providence Strategic Partners Sdn Bhd projects that \nthe wholesale value of petroleum products to increase from RM156.6 billion in 2024 to RM169.1 billion in 2027 at a \nCAGR of 2.6%. This growth will be supported by the demand drivers illustrated under Demand Conditions Key \nGrowth Drivers. \n \n(Source: \u201cIndependent Market Research Report on the Outlook of the Petroleum Products Trading and Distribution \nIndustry in Malaysia\u201d dated 22 October 2025, prepared by Providence Strategic Partners Sdn Bhd) \n \nAs disclosed in the Prospectus, the Company\u2019s business strategies and future plans are summarised as follows:  \n \ni. \nexpand its bunkering services through the acquisition of an additional bunker vessel. Upon commission of the \nadditional bunker vessel, the gross carrying capacities of its bunker vessels for fuel oils will increase from 2.4 \nmegaliters to 4.4 megaliters; \n \nii. \nexpand storage capacity to grow its distribution of fuel products business. The Tanjung Bruas Port Land at \nMelaka when fully operational will increase the Group\u2019s non-movable storage capacities from 1.5 megaliters to \n7.5 megaliters; and \n \niii. \ngrow its lubricants business by expanding with the opening of a branch office in Pahang to tap and service \ncustomers located in state of Pahang, Terengganu and Kelantan. \n \nThe economy of Malaysia expanded by 4.4% in the first half of 2025.
